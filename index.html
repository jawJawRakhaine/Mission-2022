          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we’ve examined what a mission statement is and how to
            create one, we can address the key question of this article: what
            does a good mission statement look like, and who’s doing it right?
            Here are 12 of the best mission statements for you to review and use
            as inspiration for your own.

          <img src="./images/illustrators/illustrator-2.png" alt="" />
          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            That’s where vision statements come in. Not to be confused with a
            mission statement, an effective vision statement clearly outlines
            the aspirations of your business and what you hope to achieve
            long-term. You’ll need to consider questions such as, What is your
            company’s overall vision for the future? and How are you going to
            help consumers long-term?

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Achieving goals is not as simple as thinking of something you want
            to do and then completing the task. If it was, many people would be
            very accomplished. Instead, we think of things we want to complete,
            take a few steps toward the goal, and then get distracted or
            discouraged.‌ Smaller short-term goals are easier to reach than
            long-term goals that require more of a commitment.
